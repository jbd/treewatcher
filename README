Treewatcher
===========

Treewatcher is a python library to monitor a directory recursively using inotify.
Treewatcher is still a work in progress.


Dependencies
============

inotifyx (>=0.1.1) : http://www.alittletooquiet.net/software/inotifyx/
You can install it using pip: $ pip install inotifyx

Installation
============

I suggest to use virtualenv. It will help keeping your distribution happy :)
Install inotifyx (see Dependencies) and install treewatcher :

$ git clone git://github.com/jbd/treewatcher.git
$ cd treewatcher && python setup.py install

Launching tests
===============

python setup.py test
